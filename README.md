# BART-Data-Cleaning-UC-Berkeley-Project
This is the data cleaning portion of one of the projects that I was a part of at UC Berkeley. 
The objective of the cleaning is to find the average number of passengers that entered the specific stations during the 2 defined weeks, divided by hours from 5:00 AM to 10:00 PM.
The notebook also demonstrated how i generated a polynomial expression based on the data that we have cleaned which will be used for the simulation codes.

Skills demonstrated in this notebook are Python, Numpy, Pandas, and data cleaning.
